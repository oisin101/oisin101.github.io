                <h3>Latest Developments at Hijack Games</h3>
                <p> As of the past few years we have grown a lot, and are excited to announce that...!

                    Hijack Games will be expanding further! After much trouble in planning permission Hijack
                    will be receiving an extension to our current studio along with a new building entirely!
                    We are extremely proud to have come this far and are incredibly grateful for the people
                    that have done nothing but provide us the finest support we could ever ask for.

                    With these developments, we will be able to hire more staff and speed up, along with ensure
                    higher quality of our future game projects - on this topic we can say that our next game will
                    revolve around a RPG, dungeon theme and will have many gameplay elements we have come up with
                    ourselves which we believe will provide a fun experience!

                    Thats all for now, thank you as always.
