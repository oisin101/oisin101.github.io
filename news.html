                    Dr. Dre Initially Passed On His GTA Online Appearance As He Thought It Was "For Kids":

                    Dr. Dre apparently passed on the opportunity to appear in GTA Online when it was first 
                    offered because he thought the game was “for kids.”
                    The news comes from a recent interview featuring DJ Pooh.“Initially it was just no,”
                    he said. “But thats the normal answer you get from Dre. I mean, I was surprised I got
                    him to do The Wash, but he had already promised me that, so he couldnt back out. But
                    the answer was initially no because Dres not a gamer. He just didnt play any of the
                    games. Its not like he dislikes them or something, he just didnt play them. He was
                    like I dont make things for kids.”

                    Paradox Opens Up Vampire: The Masquerade IP For Anyone To Develop, But On Questionable Terms:

                    Paradox just opened up the rights to Vampire: The Masquerade, making the intellectual property
                    available for anyone to develop. The trick is that anybody who takes the company up on this offer
                    will have to fork over about a third of their profits among numerous other catches. This of course
                    drove many to mockery. “The Vampire: The Masquerade deal is trying to have a cake and eat it too,”
                    the developer William Stiernberg joked about the matter. "Yes, make a fan game, officially! Except,
                    don't use the name of the intellectual property. Also don't fund it. We don't want you having too
                    much money up front. But if you make money on the back end, we want a large cut."

                    Judge Dismisses Most Of PlayStation Worker's Gender Discrimination Claims:

                    PlayStation has been in court over allegations of gender discrimination for several months now.
                    The latest development is that a judge has thrown out most of the claims, meaning that Sony is
                    for all intents and purposes off the hook. The main plaintiff in the case, Emma Majo, said after
                    filing the complaint that "Sony tolerates and cultivates a work environment that discriminates
                    against female employees including female employees who identify as female. Female employees are
                    subjected to continuing unlawful disparate treatment in pay and work opportunities."
